# **COSC 2328** 
### **Web Programming Assignment #6**
**Due Date:** See Canvas for due date; Link off your class web page on Reclaim and code submitted to Canvas 
For this assignment, you will modify your Assignment 5 page and make sure that all blog entries show up on your web page with the most recent entry first. All entries should be displayed in the order of most recent blog entry first (i.e., top of the screen) to oldest blog entries.

One option is to write the blog items to the file in the order in which they are entered (just as you have already done in assignment #5), and then use the array_reverse() PHP function to display in date/time order on the web page.

[Here](http://www.jbryan2.create.stedwards.edu/cosc2328/reverseArray.php) is an example of how to use array_reverse()

[Here](http://www.jbryan2.create.stedwards.edu/cosc2328/reverseArray.php.txt) is a text version.

[Here](http://www.jbryan2.create.stedwards.edu/cosc2328/reverseArray.txt) is is the example file used.

There are other options for doing this. You may find another method easier. Investigate with Google to see if PHP offers any internal helper functions.

All other requirements for assignment #5 apply. Submit your code as a .txt file to canvas and link this assignment on your main web page as "Assignment #6".
