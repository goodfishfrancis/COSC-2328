## Web Programming Assignment 2
Create a php script, asg2.php, that does the following:

* Has a welcome message
* Has a form where the user inputs his/her first name and his/her home town
* Once data is submitted, the script returns a response stating the first name and home town.
* 1 script controls the whole process. Be sure and set the php file permissions to 755. This gives the file 'execute' permissionis.
[Here][http://www.jbryan2.create.stedwards.edu/cosc2328/formTest.php] is a simple example and the php [text][http://www.jbryan2.create.stedwards.edu/cosc2328/formTestphp.txt].

Upload to canvas under Assignment 2, your php script as a TEXT file (for example: asg2LadyGaga.php.txt) and also place a link to the script under your cosc2328 assignments heading on your index.html page 'Assignment 2'. If no link is found on your home page you will receive a zero for the assignment.
