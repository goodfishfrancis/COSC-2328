#COSC 2328

##Web Programming Assignment #1

_Due Date_: See the due date for assignment #1 in Canvas

For this assignment you are to take [this html page](http://www.jbryan2.create.stedwards.edu/cosc2328/start.html) (view the html [here](http://www.jbryan2.create.stedwards.edu/cosc2328/start.txt)) and its [style sheet](http://www.jbryan2.create.stedwards.edu/cosc2328/css/start.css) and convert it to a cosc2328 home page in a cosc2328 folder on Reclaim (create). The file must be named index.html and it must reside in www/cosc2328 off your home directory by the due date shown for this assignment in Canvas.

[Help on Reclaim Hosting](http://create.stedwards.edu/) For your cosc2328 home page make the following changes to the page's html and style sheet as required:

- Change the page meta tag's author to be your name.
- Change the page title (it shows in the title bar) to your first and last name and make it clear that it is your cosc2328 home page.
- Change the image on the page to a different image that reflects your interests or hobbies or family - something nice but not much bigger or smaller, and be sure you use a non-copyrighted image and make sure you have an alt attribute within your image tag. Note that you will need to change the image tag's href to your new image (somewhere in your directory with web server access).
- Change the wording that is above the image to something appropriate for your image.
On the page itself, put new content in the top of the page in the page's actual displayed words (the actual document's content) and be sure that it makes sense for the page content, and make sure you change your hobbies.
- Change the background and text colors and make sure they have enough contrast to be readable and that they are easy to see and match well. Use the [color contrast checker](http://www.snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html) to be sure your colors are visible easily.
- Change the border color around the div that the image is in to a different and appropriate, contrasting color. (You may want to use the [color wheel](http://www.ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html) to find a nicely matching color.
- Add at least 2 more links to the page that would be useful in web programming.
- Add another heading section named cosc 2328 assignments, that will be used later for placing links to your class assignments on this class home page.
- I should be able to put http://www.yourUserName.create.stedwards.edu/cosc2328/ into a browser and get back your page as modified by you.
- Make sure your newly modified html page [validates without errors for html5](http://validator.w3.org/) .
- In addition to posting your html and css files to your create site, also submit your html and css files to Canvas.

Make sure you get the modified style sheet included correctly with the changes made as described earlier.

_Bonus Challenge 20 pts (Save up some extra credit right away...)_ Create your own CS home page. Write it using css and html. Templates (non-copyrighted) are okay as long as the html is neat and easy to read and modify. Make your page interesting and informative about you (but nothing that gives away private information). See webpagesthatsuck.com for what NOT to do and what to do on websites. To receive 20 bonus points your page must come up when I use this url http://www.yourUserName.create.stedwards.edu and it must be better than most sixth graders could do. Your html and css must validate and NOT be generated by any canned program, you must have neat and very easy to read html (structure) and decent style (css).
